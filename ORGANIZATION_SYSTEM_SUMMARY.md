## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Database Layer
```sql
-- Primary table with 25+ fields covering all organization aspects
CREATE TABLE organizations (...)

-- Support tables for flexibility
CREATE TABLE organization_aliases (...)
CREATE TABLE organization_locations (...)

-- Proper indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_organizations_tenant (tenant_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_organizations_name (name);
-- ... additional indexes
```

### Model Layer (SQLAlchemy)
```python
class Organization(Base):
    # Comprehensive field definitions
    # Proper relationships
    # Tenant isolation
```

### Schema Layer (Pydantic)
```python
class OrganizationCreate(BaseModel):
    # Input validation
    # Business rule enforcement
    # Type safety
```

### CRUD Layer
```python
def get_organizations(db, tenant_id, filters...):
    # Tenant-aware operations
    # Efficient querying
    # Error handling
```

### API Layer (FastAPI)
```python
@router.get("/organizations")
def list_organizations(...):
    # RESTful design
    # Proper HTTP status codes
    # Comprehensive error responses
```
