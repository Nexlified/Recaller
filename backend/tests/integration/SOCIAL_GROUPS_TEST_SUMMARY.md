# Social Groups Integration Tests - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Created comprehensive integration tests for all social groups management endpoints as specified in issue #47.

## Test File
- **Location**: `backend/tests/integration/test_social_groups_endpoints.py`
- **Total Tests**: 41 test cases
- **Status**: 39 passing, 2 skipped (PostgreSQL-specific features)

## Test Coverage

### 1. TestSocialGroupCRUD (12 tests)
Tests all basic CRUD operations for social groups:
- ✅ Create group (success, minimal data, validation errors, unauthenticated)
- ✅ Read group (success, not found, unauthenticated)
- ✅ Update group (success, not found, permission denied)
- ✅ Delete group (success, permission denied)

### 2. TestSocialGroupDiscovery (8 tests)
Tests search and filtering functionality:
- ✅ List groups (success, pagination)
- ⚠️ Search groups (by name/description - skipped due to PostgreSQL dependency)
- ✅ Filter by type
- ✅ Get active groups only
- ✅ Get user's created groups
- ✅ Unauthenticated access

### 3. TestSocialGroupMembership (9 tests)
Tests complete membership management:
- ✅ Get members (empty, with data)
- ✅ Add member (success, duplicate prevention)
- ✅ Update member (success, not found)
- ✅ Remove member (success, not found)
- ✅ Group not found scenarios

### 4. TestSocialGroupPermissions (7 tests)
Tests authentication and authorization:
- ✅ Tenant isolation (groups and lists)
- ✅ Privacy level enforcement
- ✅ Authentication requirements
- ✅ Invalid token handling
- ✅ Owner permissions

### 5. TestSocialGroupValidation (5 tests)
Tests data validation and edge cases:
- ✅ Group type validation
- ✅ Privacy level validation
- ✅ Meeting frequency validation
- ✅ Membership role validation
- ✅ Membership status validation

## Endpoints Tested
All 13 required endpoints from the issue specification:

| Endpoint | Method | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| `/api/v1/social-groups/` | GET | ✅ Tested |
| `/api/v1/social-groups/search` | GET | ⚠️ PostgreSQL-dependent |
| `/api/v1/social-groups/types/{group_type}` | GET | ✅ Tested |
| `/api/v1/social-groups/active` | GET | ✅ Tested |
| `/api/v1/social-groups/my-groups` | GET | ✅ Tested |
| `/api/v1/social-groups/` | POST | ✅ Tested |
| `/api/v1/social-groups/{id}` | GET | ✅ Tested |
| `/api/v1/social-groups/{id}` | PUT | ✅ Tested |
| `/api/v1/social-groups/{id}` | DELETE | ✅ Tested |
| `/api/v1/social-groups/{id}/members` | GET | ✅ Tested |
| `/api/v1/social-groups/{id}/members` | POST | ✅ Tested |
| `/api/v1/social-groups/{id}/members/{contact_id}` | PUT | ✅ Tested |
| `/api/v1/social-groups/{id}/members/{contact_id}` | DELETE | ✅ Tested |

## Technical Implementation

### Test Infrastructure
- Extended `conftest.py` with social group models
- Added Contact, SocialGroup, Membership, and Activity test models
- Proper database schema for comprehensive testing
- JWT authentication setup with multiple test users

### Features Tested
- **Authentication**: All endpoints require proper JWT tokens
- **Authorization**: Owner-based permissions for updates/deletes
- **Tenant Isolation**: Groups isolated by tenant context
- **Data Validation**: All input validation and business rules
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- **Edge Cases**: Missing data, duplicates, non-existent resources

### Database Compatibility
- Tests use SQLite for speed and simplicity
- PostgreSQL-specific features (JSON array operations) are gracefully skipped
- Production would use PostgreSQL with full search functionality

## Success Criteria Met
- [x] All social group endpoints have comprehensive test coverage
- [x] Group CRUD operations work correctly
- [x] Search and filtering functionality is accurate (where database-compatible)
- [x] Membership management functions properly
- [x] Privacy and permission controls work
- [x] Tenant isolation is enforced

## Notes
- 2 tests skipped due to PostgreSQL-specific JSON operators in search functionality
- Tests follow existing repository patterns and conventions
- Compatible with existing test infrastructure
- One pre-existing test failure in user endpoints (unrelated to this implementation)

## Usage
```bash
# Run all social groups tests
pytest tests/integration/test_social_groups_endpoints.py -v

# Run specific test class
pytest tests/integration/test_social_groups_endpoints.py::TestSocialGroupCRUD -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/integration/test_social_groups_endpoints.py --cov=app.api.v1.endpoints.social_groups
```
