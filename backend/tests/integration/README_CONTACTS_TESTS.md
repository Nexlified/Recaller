- ✅ Event relationship handling during deletion

### 9. TestContactBulkOperations (2 tests)
Performance and bulk operation scenarios:
- ✅ Multiple contact creation efficiency
- ✅ Search performance with larger datasets

### 10. TestContactDataIntegrity (3 tests)
Data consistency and integrity:
- ✅ Duplicate email handling
- ✅ Data consistency after multiple updates
- ✅ Null and empty field handling

### 11. TestContactSecurityAndValidation (3 tests)
Advanced security and validation:
- ✅ Field length limit validation
- ✅ Email format variation testing
- ✅ Concurrent access scenarios

## API Endpoints Tested

| Endpoint | Method | Test Coverage |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| `/api/v1/contacts/` | GET | ✅ List, pagination, empty state |
| `/api/v1/contacts/search/` | GET | ✅ Search by name/email, pagination, edge cases |
| `/api/v1/contacts/{contact_id}` | GET | ✅ Retrieve, not found, authentication |
| `/api/v1/contacts/` | POST | ✅ Create, validation, security, edge cases |
| `/api/v1/contacts/{contact_id}` | PUT | ✅ Update, partial update, validation |
| `/api/v1/contacts/{contact_id}` | DELETE | ✅ Delete, cascade, not found |
| `/api/v1/contacts/{contact_id}/events` | GET | ✅ Events list, invalid contact |
| `/api/v1/contacts/{contact_id}/shared-events/{other_contact_id}` | GET | ✅ Shared events, validation |

## Requirements Satisfied

### ✅ CRUD Operations
- Create contacts with validation
- Read contact information and lists
- Update contact details (full and partial)
- Delete contacts with cascade effects

### ✅ Search Functionality
- Text search across contact fields
- Pagination and filtering
- Empty result handling
- Special characters in search

### ✅ Relationships
- Contact-event associations
- Shared events between contacts
- Organization affiliations (tested via model relationships)
- Social group memberships (tested via cascade operations)

### ✅ Data Validation
- Required field enforcement
- Email/phone format validation
- Duplicate contact handling
- Input sanitization (SQL injection, XSS protection)

### ✅ Technical Requirements
- pytest framework usage
- Authenticated user context
- Tenant isolation validation
- Pagination and search parameters
- Cascade delete operations

## Bug Fixes Applied

During test development, the following issues were identified and fixed:

1. **Schema-Model Mismatch**: Contact schema had `title`, `company`, and `notes` fields that didn't exist in the Contact model. Removed these fields from the schema to align with the actual model.

2. **Search Function Bug**: The search functionality was trying to search on a non-existent `company` field. Updated to search only on `full_name` and `email` fields.

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all contacts integration tests
pytest tests/integration/test_contacts_endpoints.py -v

# Run specific test class
pytest tests/integration/test_contacts_endpoints.py::TestContactCRUDOperations -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/integration/test_contacts_endpoints.py --cov=app.api.v1.endpoints.contacts --cov=app.crud.contact -v
```

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with CI/CD pipeline
- Performance benchmarking for large datasets
- Load testing for concurrent operations
- Additional relationship testing with actual event and organization data
